      <dt> <font color="skyblue">What is Data?</font></dt>
      <dd>In computing, data is information that has been translated into a form that is efficient for movement or processing.
               Relative to today's computers and transmission media, data is information converted into binary digital form.
               It is acceptable for data to be used as a singular subject or a plural subject. Raw data is a term used to describe data in its most basic digital format.

       <dt> <font color="skyblue">Data Mining</font></dt>
       <dd>Data mining, also known as knowledge discovery in data (KDD), is the process of uncovering patterns and other valuable information from
               large data sets. Given the evolution of data warehousing technology and the growth of big data, adoption of data mining techniques has rapidly accelerated
               over the last couple of decades, assisting companies by transforming their raw data into useful knowledge.

         <dt><font color="skyblue"> Data WareHouse</font></dt>
       <dd>A data warehouse is a type of data management system that is designed to enable and support business intelligence (BI) activities, especially analytics.
                Data warehouses are solely intended to perform queries and analysis and often contain large amounts of historical data.
                The data within a data warehouse is usually derived from a wide range of sources such as application log files and transaction applications.

       <dt> <font color="skyblue">Artificial Intelligence</font></dt>
      <dd>Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include
               expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision.

        <dt> <font color="skyblue">Machine Learning</font></dt>
      <dd>Machine learning is an important component of the growing field
              of data science. Through the use of statistical methods, algorithms are trained to make classifications or predictions, uncovering key insights within data mining projects.
              These insights subsequently drive decision making within applications and businesses, ideally impacting key growth metrics.

       <dt> <font color="skyblue">Deep Learning</font></dt>
      <dd>Deep learning is a subset of machine learning (ML), which is itself a subset of artificial intelligence (AI). The concept of AI has been around since the 1950s, with the goal of making computers able to think and reason in a way similar to humans.
         As part of making machines able to think, ML is focused on how to make them learn without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning goes beyond ML by creating more complex hierarchical models that are meant to mimic how humans learn new information.

        <dt> <font color="skyblue">Data Analytics</font></dt>
      <dd>Data analytics is a broad term that encompasses many diverse types of data analysis.
        Any type of information can be subjected to data analytics techniques to get insight that can be
        used to improve things. Data analytics techniques can reveal trends and metrics that would otherwise
        be lost in the mass of information. This information can then be used to optimize processes to
        increase the overall efficiency of a business or system.
