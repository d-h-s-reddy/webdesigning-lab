	<h1><p>A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of 
arithmetic or logical operations automatically. Modern computers can 
perform generic sets of operations known as programs. 
These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a "complete" computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), 
and peripheral equipment needed and used for "full" operation.</p></h1>
